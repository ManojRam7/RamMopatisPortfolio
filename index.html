        <!-- Replace your current summary paragraph with this -->
        <p class="work-summary">
          As a Data Analyst, I played a key role in transforming raw insurance and policy data into actionable business insights by collaborating with Business Analysts, Scrum Leads, and product managers to meet evolving business requirements. I conducted in-depth exploratory data analysis (EDA), built SQL-based reports, and designed interactive dashboards using Power BI that empowered business teams to make informed, data-driven decisions.
          My work involved automating reporting pipelines using Azure Databricks and PySpark to enhance the efficiency of data processing tasks, especially for large-scale claim and policy datasets (10M+ rows). I also developed Python scripts for data transformation, anomaly detection, and analytical modeling to support strategic decisions.
          Additionally, I was responsible for creating and maintaining clear documentation of data processes, validation rules, and business logic to ensure transparency, reusability, and audit-readiness. I actively participated in Agile/Scrum ceremoniesâ€”including sprint planning, reviews, and retrospectivesâ€”which enabled collaborative progress tracking and iterative delivery of analytics solutions.
          These contributions collectively led to improved data visibility, a 50% reduction in manual reporting efforts, faster reporting cycles, and more consistent stakeholder engagement through high-quality, insight-driven deliverables.
